CTRiskSeg will soon be a library for automatic segmentation of some organs from CT images. It's intended use is a segmentation engine for [OpenDXMC](https://github.com/medicalphysics/OpenDXMC), a GUI application for Monte Carlo dose simulation for diagnostic beam energy levels.

More will follow after initial release.
